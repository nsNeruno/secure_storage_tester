# secure_storage_tester

Test App for flutter_secure_storage.

## Getting Started

Clone the project, and run `flutter pub get` on the project root.

## Notes

- I mainly deal with Mobile Apps so I didn't test with non Mobile platforms neither did I enable the platforms
- I do not provide `deleteAll` shortcut. Modify and test at your own risk.
